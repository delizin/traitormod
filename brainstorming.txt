Swayze Brainstorming:
Everyone:
Steal the Captain’s/Security Officer’s/Medic’s ID

The Perfect Heist
“Convince” the captain to transfer at least 2,000mks to your personal account and survive the round
Escape from the sub with a crate full of at least 1,000mks worth of sell-only loot, such as moloch bones, and survive the round. If successful, set the crate aside and sell it at the next colony. You receive 50% of the money from the sale.

Person for the Ethical Treatment of Monstrosities
<Juvenile/Aduly> Monstrosities of type <x> have recently been classified as endangered. Ensure that none are hurt this round.
Hatch and ensure the safety of 3 eggs
(long term) Secretly raise <X> dangerous creature to adulthood on board the submarine

Dark Jester
Incapacitate another player and steal their identity for 5 minutes
Set off a dirty bomb on the sub without killing anyone or destroying any items
Replace 3 welders oxygen tanks/diving suits air tanks with welding/oxygen tanks
Slip at least 10 players with banana peels

Upstart Pirate Lord
Convince one person per round to support you in an upcoming mutiny. If your plot is discovered, you must immediately begin the mutiny.
(long term) Incite a mutiny against the current captain and become the new captain

Separatist Agitator
Deduce the identity of the Coalition Spy and eliminate them without anyone noticing
Eliminate the Cargo (if taken from the opposite faction)
Frame someone else as the spy (have them handcuffed for 120 seconds for a crime you committed)

Coalition Spy
Deduce the identity of the Coalition Spy and eliminate them without anyone noticing
Eliminate the Cargo (if taken from the opposite faction)
Frame someone else as the agitator (have them handcuffed for 120 seconds for a crime you committed)
Discreetly install a console and send x information to y channel (Could spawn a memory card / pda with some info in the captain’s locker on round start that you’d need to get the information off of, then the game checks for that info on the channel)

Suzera Ideas:
try not to get suspected before your hijink is done
blow a hole in the ship using a non-nuclear explosive during a fight
destroy engine during a fight
cut 3 important wires
sonar pulse when trying to run silent
hide the welding tools from the npc repairers (maybe too much like welding them in a room idk)
"accidentally" have the ship fight an abyss monster
rotate directions you give people by 90 degrees
decide to use an entirely different orienting system than usual
be inaccurate with bullets
drop a mininuke when nobody else is around (but not where items can fall out)
husk yourself and try to turn in a convenient place to get more players
find a way to go unconscious implausibly or inconveniently, but not dead so people have to scramble to rescue you. give poor directions
that piezo crystal explosion was a bit too close
drone goes on adventure. maybe needlessly.
tell people the wrong room names for where things and events are, especially when monsters are on the boat
spread ammo boxes across the ship

Other ideas:
Lone operative spawns in a shuttle, job is to infiltrate ship crew
Sub edits to make important wires hard-wired
Evil clone: You spawn in as someone else, exact copy of gear and name, and your job is to murder the original and take their place
Speed: wire a bomb on the ship that triggers if the boat drops below X speed

Suzera’s suggestions:
no:
-specifically murder
-destroy items
-just waste items (including like the thing tried last night after being cuffed by telling the ai to use medicines)
-hide things in toxin/security containers
-don't retrieve corpses
-using discord/ooc chat to to lie about traitor stuff
-disordering the main resource storages or other non-final products. handling this is already a pain and would only increase tedium, not danger
party foul:
-knowingly kill an npc (or maybe reduce cost and increase availability so we can kill them with less consequence)
-the whole medbay fort deal type stuff where it gets in the way of regular gameplay even when not traitoring
