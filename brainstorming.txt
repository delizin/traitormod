Swayze Brainstorming

Traitor Role Terms
  "Objective success/fail"
    - Traitor succeeds/fails a specific objective. Could be a minor bonus (10% of mission earnings per?). Not paid unless the role succeeds.
  "Role success/fail"
    - Traitor succeeds/fails the main objective (20% of mission earnings per?). Traitor has to succeed in their role to get any payout.
  "Role foul"
    - Yellow card/Too much damage. Could be from going too hard or just bad luck/planning/communication.
    - Role Foul is the stat to track in terms of correcting and if necessarily penalizing unruly behavior. If we ever wanted to automate this, I'd suggest at the end of the round the traitor chooses which objectives they think they completed, then the final proposal appears as a single vote if the traitor role successed, failed, or fouled. If that's too complex, perhaps just do the single vote which includes (traitor role success 30%, traitor role success 20%, traitor role success 10%, role fail, role foul), display the traitor objectives for everyone, and allow the traitor to make their case in voice. It should default to role success 10% to encourage people to participate.

Innocence System 
  Disclaimer: Any disagreements about rule interpretation, intent, or otherwise should be settled by a simple vote of those online in a timely fashion. This game involves quick thinking and deception and will involve many, many poor collective decisions. This shouldn't be taken personally - if you feel you were wronged, try not to carry it with you into the next round. We are all doing our best and trying to have fun.

  Voting Suggestion
  We could utilize the instant voting system for crew member Role Fouls if there is some way to specify a custom entry. Example: I kill bootman because I think he's a traitor but he's not, so he submits a vote to assign Swayze a role foul with the custom text "Swayze killed me while I was Innocent

  This system is designed to be simple, encourage communication, prevent too much friendly fire, and still be gameable. The Captain and Security have additional leway in this system and should be duly resented for it. Traitors are encouraged to exploit this system to the fullest. 
    "Innocent"
      - Everyone on the ship starts out innocent.
      - Harming or arresting an innocent person counts as a Role Foul.
    "Sus"
      - Anyone can declare another person "Sus" at any time. This involves stating who and what they did in radio 0000 voice.. This step must be completed fully before the person is considered Sus, otherwise they are still considered innocent and any action against them is grounds for a Role Foul. No radio = no ability to declare someone Sus.
      - Anyone directly involved in the death or knocking unconscious of a Sus person recieves a Role Foul.
      - Once a person is Sus, they can be ragdolled, handcuffed, and searched on the spot. The crew has 1 minute to do this, after which the person is no longer considered Sus. 
      - The Captain and Security Officers can each arrest and lock one Sus person at a time inside a room for up to 5 minutes while the ship crew undertakes a longer search or investigation. They must remain in the room with the person for the duration. This can be done once per arrester per person per round (You could lock up someone twice, but a different person would have to do it each time).
    "Hostile"
      - If a person declared Sus doesn't cooperate, they can be declared hostile. Declaring someone hostile requires stating who they are and what they did in radio 0000 voice.
      - Declaring someone hostile requires another person seconding it on radio 0000 voice (unless there are 3 or fewer people left).
      - Once per round, the Captain can unilaterally declare someone Hostile.
      - Crewmembers can take agressive action against Hostile players up to knocking them out. The exception to this is self-defense: if a normal crewmember is actively being attacked, then they can fight back however they like.
      - If the crew unanimously votes for it, they can make a Hostile player KOS.
      - Once per round, a Hostile player may surrender by announcing it on radio 0000 voice and dropping limp to the ground. They are then considered Sus and must remain limp until they are restrained. False surrenders are allowed but make the false surrenderer automatically and permanently KOS.

Basic profession traitor roles (maybe like 50% odds each time?)

Rare traitors (much more dangerous, always requires a round restart, selected some % of the time a traitor is rolled (would keep this low, say 10%, by default), chosen randomly from this list. If too much, could do a gentlemens' agreement to simply not play these roles when asssigned):
  "Changeling"
  - Kill everyone aboard the sub, one-by-one. You must take on the identity of the person you kill (clothes, ID, and obscure face) before killing anyone else. When you assume an identity, you may choose to send the player a screenshot of this message. They are now on your side and speak for you. They must try their best to help you achieve your objective. For the hivemind!

  "Husk Patient Zero"
  - Kill everyone aboard the sub, including yourself, with a husk infection. Once infected, you can only talk in groans. Long live the Cult!
  
  "Prophet of Dagon"
  - Kill everyone aboard the sub, including yourself, by sinking it below crush depth. As the ship passes crush depth you must recite a psalm to your dark master on the radio to seal the compact. Once below crush depth the ship's crew need not die from water pressure (sometimes Dagon can use an extra hand), but if any crew manage to escape crush depth, even without the sub, then you have failed. Iä Dagon!

  "Separatist Revolutionary"
  - Kill everyone who isn't a fellow Revolutionary. When the round starts, message up to one-quarter of the other players (rounding down, minimum of 1) with a screenshot of this message. They are now your fellow Revolutionaries and are fully loyal to you. Begin sewing the seeds of your revolution. When you are ready, you must give the spoken signal to begin your revolution on channel 0000: <randomly generated phrase>. On the signal, all revolutionaries must don matching outfits, remove their oppressive IDs, and cover their faces. Down with the bourgeoisie pigs!
  
  "Coalition Nuclear Operative"
  - Kill everyone aboard the sub, including yourself, with a single large detonation synchronized via a signal or chain reaction. You must clearly and slowly count down from 5 to 0 in voice before detonating the explosives.

Suzera Ideas:
try not to get suspected before your hijink is done
blow a hole in the ship using a non-nuclear explosive during a fight
destroy engine during a fight
cut 3 important wires
sonar pulse when trying to run silent
hide the welding tools from the npc repairers (maybe too much like welding them in a room idk)
"accidentally" have the ship fight an abyss monster
rotate directions you give people by 90 degrees
decide to use an entirely different orienting system than usual
be inaccurate with bullets
drop a mininuke when nobody else is around (but not where items can fall out)
husk yourself and try to turn in a convenient place to get more players
find a way to go unconscious implausibly or inconveniently, but not dead so people have to scramble to rescue you. give poor directions
that piezo crystal explosion was a bit too close
drone goes on adventure. maybe needlessly.
tell people the wrong room names for where things and events are, especially when monsters are on the boat
spread ammo boxes across the ship

Other ideas:
Lone operative spawns in a shuttle, job is to infiltrate ship crew
Sub edits to make important wires hard-wired
Evil clone: You spawn in as someone else, exact copy of gear and name, and your job is to murder the original and take their place
Speed: wire a bomb on the ship that triggers if the boat drops below X speed

Suzera’s suggestions:
no:
-specifically murder
-destroy items
-just waste items (including like the thing tried last night after being cuffed by telling the ai to use medicines)
-hide things in toxin/security containers
-don't retrieve corpses
-using discord/ooc chat to to lie about traitor stuff
-disordering the main resource storages or other non-final products. handling this is already a pain and would only increase tedium, not danger
party foul:
-knowingly kill an npc (or maybe reduce cost and increase availability so we can kill them with less consequence)
-the whole medbay fort deal type stuff where it gets in the way of regular gameplay even when not traitoring
